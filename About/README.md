This folder contains mod metadata.

- **About.xml** is used to provide RimWorld with basic information about the mod.
- **Manifest.xml** is used to provide additional information about the mod.
- **Preview.png** is the image used to represent the mod. The recommended dimensions are 640x360, but it can be any size.
- **PublishedFileId.txt** is generated by Steam when you upload the mod for the first time.

A good font to use in the **Preview.png** is RimWord by Dimitry Kulik. It can be downloaded [here](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=11022.0).
