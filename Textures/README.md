# /Textures
The contents of this folder can be formatted however you would like, but it must contain all of your textures.

Here is an example Textures folder structure (from my Christmas Hats mod):
- Textures
	- Things
		- SantaHat
			- SantaHat.png
			- SantaHat_east.png
			- SantaHat_north.png
			- SantaHat_south.png

Note that the file names are important in the example above; since the item is apparel, it has one version for an item on the ground and three for the different directions that a pawn wearing it can face (a "west" version is automatically generated by flipping the "east" version). When referencing this texture in an XML definition, it would be called "Things/SantaHat/SantaHat".
