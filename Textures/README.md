# /Textures

This folder contains image files supplied by the mod.

## File structure

There is no well-defined file structure for this folder, but in some cases files must be named in a specific format.

### Example

Here is an example Textures folder structure (from my Christmas Hats mod):

- `Things`
	- `SantaHat`
		- `SantaHat.png`
		- `SantaHat_east.png`
		- `SantaHat_north.png`
		- `SantaHat_south.png`

Note that the file names are important in the example above; since the item is apparel, it has one version for an item on the ground and three for the different directions that a pawn wearing it can face (a "west" version is automatically generated by flipping the "east" version).
When referencing this texture in an XML definition, it would be called `Things/SantaHat/SantaHat`.
